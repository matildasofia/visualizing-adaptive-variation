# "Plot 1" - FST
This directory has an example plot of Divergence data (FST) from the Google Drive

For this to work, the .tsv files needed to first be converted to .csv

The path to the .tsv files is commented out in manual_url_plot_1.js

If you want to compare with the data from the Uppmax, just comment out in the HTML script so manual_url_plot_1_uppmax_data.js is used instead!
